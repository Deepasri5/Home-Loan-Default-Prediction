# 🏠 Home Loan Default Risk Management

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of home loan defaults using Machine Learning. The primary goal is to determine whether a loan applicant will be able to repay the loan or face difficulties. By analyzing historical customer data, financial institutions can make data-driven decisions to minimize credit risk and optimize lending strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To identify significant factors that contribute to loan default.
- To perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand applicant demographics.
- To build and evaluate multiple classification models for accurate risk prediction.
- To provide actionable insights for risk mitigation in the banking sector.

## 🚀 Key Features & Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generated over 15 visualizations to identify correlations between income, credit history, and default status.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived new features to enhance model predictive power.
- **Model Implementation:** Developed models using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to ensure a balance between risk detection and customer retention.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Summary of Results
- The project successfully identified that credit history and annual income are the strongest predictors of loan repayment.
- Developed a comprehensive ML pipeline that handles data from raw format to final model evaluation.
